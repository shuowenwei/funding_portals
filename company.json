I did see that 7% inflation is expected via validator rewards\nIs the 7% inflation static? Every year supply goes up by 7%?\"\n\nMy answer: We will be using the Cosmos framework, likely with default settings, which would mean that inflation will target 7% per year. In this scenario, if 70% of the tokens are staked, the inflation will be 7%. If less than 70% tokens are staked it will be more, and if more than 70% staked, less.\n\nHowever, these plans may still change, and once the chain is live, it will be controlled by the validators selected by the token holders, not us directly.",
